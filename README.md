# bpmnlint

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint)

Validate your BPMN diagrams based on configurable lint rules.


## Usage

Install the utility via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpmnlint):

```sh
npm install -g bpmnlint
```

Validate your diagrams via the commandline:

```sh
> bpmnlint invoice.bpmn

/Projects/process-application/resources/invoice.bpmn
  Flow_1    error    Sequence flow is missing condition  conditional-flows
  Process   error    Process is missing end event        end-event-required
  Task_13   warning  Element is missing label/name       label-required
  Event_12  warning  Element is missing label/name       label-required
  Event_27  warning  Element is missing label/name       label-required
  Process   error    Process is missing start event      start-event-required

âœ– 6 problems (6 errors, 0 warnings)

## Rules

Our [documentation](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint/tree/master/docs/rules#rules) lists all currenty implemented rules, the [`./rules` folder](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint/tree/master/rules) contains each rules implementation.

Do you miss a rule that should be included? [Propose a new rule](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint/issues/new?template=NEW_RULE.md).


## Configuration

Create a `.bpmnlintrc` file in your working directory and inherit from a common configuration using the `extends` block:

```json
{
  "extends": "bpmnlint:recommended"
}
```

Add or customize rules using the `rules` block:

```json
{
  "extends": "bpmnlint:recommended",
  "rules": {
    "label-required": "off"
  }
}
```


## Visual Feedback

Integrate the linter via [bpmn-js-bpmnlint](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-bpmnlint) into [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and get direct feedback during modeling.

To try out visual validation, checkout the [bpmnlint playground](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint-playground).


## Writing / Consuming Custom Rules

Use the [bpmnlint playground](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint-playground) to implement new rules with quick visual feedback.

For more details on how to define and consume custom lint rules check out the [bpmnlint-plugin-example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint-plugin-example).
